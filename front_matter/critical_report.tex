– & –    & –    & Irregular lengths of measures in \A1 (in \textit{Christe},
                  \textit{Qui tollis}, and \textit{Quoniam})
                  have been retained in this edition. \\
  &      & ob   & In several movements of \A1
                  (\textit{Christe} and \textit{Quoniam}),
                  the directives “Tutti” and “Vv.” in the violin parts
                  indicate the beginning and end of segments where the oboes
                  should play unison with the violins. Based on these
                  directives, the oboe parts of this edition have been
                  assembled. Nevertheless, the directives are retained
                  in the violin parts. If a chord appears in the violin part,
                  only the highest note is retained for the oboe part. \\

                      directives, it is unclear if and when ob should pause
                      during the movement. Thus, bars 452, 498f, 502–505,
